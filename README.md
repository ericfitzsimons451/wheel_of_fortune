#####
```open indel.html in your browser ```

## Background/About
#### This project was an opportunity to explore the use of ES6 classes.  As Turing students, we previously had some exposure to this type of organization in previous projects, but this was the first chance we had to create a game solely based on this type of code structure.  Another large portion of this project was to test functionality of not only the class interaction but also the updates made on the DOM.  As well, it offered us a chance to work on our own and improve our pull-request and code reviw skillsets.

## Primary Technologies Used
- jQuery
- Mocha
- Chai
- Chai-spies

## Next Steps
#### Future iterations of the project could include:
- A.I. players
- More robust/exciting UI/UX 
- High score list
