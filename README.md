# Crushing Debt Forgiveness Wheel! (Wheel of Fortune)
#### A web-based game of Wheel of Fortune created using object oriented programming and ES6 syntax.

## Installation Steps
```git clone https://github.com/ericweissman/wheel_of_fortune.git```
#####
```npm install```

## Background/About
#### This project was an opportunity to explore the use of ES6 classes and object oritented program.  As Turing students, previous projects allowed for some exposure to this type of organization, but this was the first chance we had to create a game solely based on this code structure.  Another large portion of this project was to implement a testing suite for not only the class interactions, but also any updates made on the DOM. 

## Primary Technologies Used
- jQuery
- Mocha
- Chai
- Chai-spies

## Next Steps
#### Future iterations of the project could include:
- More robust testing suite
- A.I. players
- More robust/exciting UI/UX
- Additional animations and transitions between rounds
- High score list
